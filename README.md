# o_calculator
Gustavo's Calculator Project from the Odin Project | Foundations | Javascript Basics


notes:

-re made project, because js file broke formatting on vscode, i've saved in in the jsformatbreak.txt file
-proud of simplicity, but i think i can make a separate functions for the operation display itself

missing:
-keyboard support
-message for operating by zero
-decimals
-delete one digit input rather than whole input
